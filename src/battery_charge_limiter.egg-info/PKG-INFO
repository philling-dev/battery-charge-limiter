A modern and user-friendly utility to limit battery charging on your Linux laptop, helping to extend battery lifespan and health.

## ✨ Features

- **🖥️ Graphical Interface:** Easy-to-use GUI for non-technical users with system tray support
- **⌨️ Command Line Interface:** Powerful CLI for advanced users and automation
- **🔋 Extends Battery Lifespan:** Prevents constant 100% charging that degrades battery over time
- **⚡ Real-time Control:** Instantly apply charge limits without rebooting
- **🎯 Smart Presets:** Quick preset options (60%, 80%, 90%) for different usage patterns
- **📊 Battery Information:** Display detailed battery model, manufacturer, and status
- **🔄 Persistent Settings:** Charge limits persist across reboots via systemd service
- **🛠️ Broad Compatibility:** Works with most ASUS, Lenovo, Dell, and other laptops supporting sysfs

## 🚀 Installation

### Quick Install

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/philling-dev/battery-charge-limiter.git
   cd battery-charge-limiter
   ```

2. **Run the installation script:**
   ```bash
   bash install.sh
   ```

The installer will:
- Install system dependencies (Python, PyQt6)
- Check battery charge limiting compatibility  
- Install the application with both GUI and CLI interfaces
- Create desktop menu entry for easy access
- Set up optional systemd service for automatic application

### What Gets Installed

- **GUI Application:** `battery-limiter-gui` - Graphical interface accessible from applications menu
- **CLI Tool:** `battery-limiter` - Command-line interface for scripts and advanced users  
- **Desktop Entry:** "Battery Charge Limiter" appears in Settings/System categories
- **System Tray:** Convenient access and quick controls

## 📖 Usage

### 🖥️ Graphical Interface (Recommended for most users)

**Launch from Applications Menu:**
- Search for "Battery Charge Limiter" in your applications menu
- Or run: `battery-limiter-gui`

**Features:**
- **Real-time Display:** Shows current charge limit and battery information
- **Easy Controls:** Drag slider or use preset buttons (60%, 80%, 90%)
- **System Tray:** Minimizes to system tray for convenient access
- **Quick Actions:** Right-click tray icon for instant limit changes
- **Visual Feedback:** Clear status indicators and notifications

### ⌨️ Command Line Interface

**Basic Usage:**
```bash
battery-limiter 80          # Set charge limit to 80%
battery-limiter 60          # Set charge limit to 60%
battery-limiter --info 90   # Show battery info and set to 90%
```

**Examples:**
```bash
# Set conservative limit for maximum lifespan
battery-limiter 60

# Set balanced limit for daily use  
battery-limiter 80

# Set extended limit for travel days
battery-limiter 90

# Check current battery information
battery-limiter --info 80
```

### 🎯 Recommended Limits

- **60% (Conservative):** Maximum battery lifespan, ideal for plugged-in workstations
- **80% (Balanced):** Good compromise between lifespan and capacity, recommended for daily use
- **90% (Extended):** Slightly reduced lifespan but more capacity for travel/mobility

## 🗑️ Uninstallation

To remove the Battery Charge Limiter from your system:

```bash
sudo bash uninstall.sh
```

## 💻 Compatibility

This utility attempts to automatically detect the battery charge control file on your system. It looks for common paths like `/sys/class/power_supply/BAT*/charge_control_end_threshold` and `charge_stop_threshold`.

**Your laptop needs to expose this functionality via `sysfs` for this utility to work.** Many modern ASUS, Lenovo, and Dell laptops support this. If the utility does not work, your hardware might not be compatible or might use a different path.
